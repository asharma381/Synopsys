MetaWear iOS/macOS/tvOS API
===========================

The MetaWear iOS/macOS/tvOS API provides a simple way to communicate with your MetaWear boards using Apple devices.  This guide will cover the functionality of the API.  If you are interested in the finer details of the library, the source code is available on our `GitHub page <https://github.com/mbientlab/MetaWear-SDK-iOS-macOS-tvOS>`_ and API documentation is on our `website <https://mbientlab.com/docs/metawear/ios/latest/>`_.


Getting Started
---------------

This guide assumes you have fundamental knowledge of iOS, macOS, or tvOS programming especially `Swift <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html>`_ and `Closures <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Closures.html>`_.

If you are not developing for the Apple ecosystem, we also offer an `Android API <http://mbientlab.com/androiddocs/latest/>`_ and `C++ API <https://mbientlab.com/cppdocs/latest/>`_.
